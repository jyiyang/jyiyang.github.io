I am a second-year Master student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Prof. Michael Kaess](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/) in the [Robot Perception Lab](http://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/). My research interest lies robotics in general, and particularly in SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and state estimation of robots. 

I graduated from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in 2017 and worked at the [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/) with [Prof. Christopher Clark](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/chris-clark), where I worked on multi-agent systems and path planning. 

I worked at Apple as a summer intern in 2016, where I experimented on inertial sensors and devices in the CoreMotion team.
