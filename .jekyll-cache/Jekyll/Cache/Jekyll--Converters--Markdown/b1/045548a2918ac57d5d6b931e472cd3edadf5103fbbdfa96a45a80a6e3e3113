I"‡<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I am a Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.nuro.ai/">Nuro</a> working on mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles. I am interested in machine learning, state estimation, and writing good software for robotics. Checkout our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13896">latest work</a> in using widely available aerial data for ML-based localization for autonomous vehicle in ICRA 2025.</p>

<p>Previously I worked on Perception at Phiar, a startup focusing on combining augmented reality, road understanding, and in-car navigation. Phiar was acquired by Google in 2022.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Master degree in Robotics at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University in 2019. I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/">Prof. Michael Kaess</a> in the <a href="https://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/">Robot Perception Lab</a>.</p>
