I am a SLAM engineer at [PHIAR](https://www.phiar.net/), a startup focusing on combining augmented reality, road understanding, and in-car navigation. Check out our latest collaboration [here](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/tech/panasonic-augmented-reality-head-up-display/index.html). 

I obtained my Master degree in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University in 2019. I worked with [Prof. Michael Kaess](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/) in the [Robot Perception Lab](http://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/). My research interest lies robotics in general, and particularly in 3D reconstruction, SLAM, and state estimation. 

I graduated from [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) with a Bachelor degree in engineering in 2017. I worked at the [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/) with [Prof. Christopher Clark](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/chris-clark). I had a great time working on algorithms in multi-robot system and path planning.

I worked at Apple as a summer intern in 2016, where I worked on pose estimation using portable inertial sensors in the CoreMotion team.
