### About

I am a Tech Lead at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/) working on mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles. I am interested in machine learning, state estimation, and writing good software for robotics. Checkout our [latest work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13896) in using widely available aerial data for ML-based localization for autonomous vehicle in ICRA 2025.

Previously I worked on Perception at Phiar, a startup focusing on combining augmented reality, road understanding, and in-car navigation. Phiar was acquired by Google in 2022.

I graduated with a Master degree in Robotics at [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University in 2019. I worked with [Prof. Michael Kaess](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaess/) in the [Robot Perception Lab](https://rpl.ri.cmu.edu/).
